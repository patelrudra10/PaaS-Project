application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

# STEPS

1. Open Github Desktop

* Create a new repository
* It should contains the git attributes
* Named it as Paas-Project
* Push to origin
* Place the PaaS Code provided by sir, inside that repositoy and commit to main.

2. Create an Heroku Account

* Sign up with college email id
* Select the langugage to be Ruby.

3. Make New App

* Give any name of your choice I gave it - rudra-development
* Dont do anything in add pipe simply 
* Click the create button

4. Link Heroku To Github

* Give authorized access of Github to heroku
