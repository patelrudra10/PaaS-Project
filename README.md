# STEPS

1. Open Github Desktop

* Create a new repository
* It should contains the git attributes
* Named it as Paas-Project
* Push to origin

* Sign up with college email id
* Select the langugage to be Ruby.

3. Make New App

* Dont do anything in add pipe simply 
* Click the create button

4. Link Heroku To Github
